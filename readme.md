# PamChat

PamChat is a chatbot that can answer questions related to methods used in PamGene. It is a custom RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) that knows only PamGene documentation, namely github readmes and the texts of instruction videos. Since PamChat only knows PamGene documentation, it is not confused by other data on the internet.

Since the PamGene readmes are regularly updated, PamChat is updated every day as well.

## Usage

In order for PamChat to remember your previous questions on the same day, give your name.
